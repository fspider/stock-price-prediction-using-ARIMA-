Description of Research question
Historical Trading data, which are inevitably associated with the framework of causality both financially and theoretically, 
were widely used to predict stock market values. The aim of this study was to investigate the performances of forecasting
stock prices by historical trading data from Yahoo finance using R package (GetBatchSymbols) over a timespan of 10 years. 
In addition, Auto-correlation function and Partial Auto-correlation function were used to see if the series are correlated
with its lags and finally ARIMA model is used for predicting stock prices. The stocks in focus for this project were 
AAPL (Apple), GOOGL (Alphabet Inc.), AMZ (Amazon), DIS (Disney) and WMT (Walmart corporations).
